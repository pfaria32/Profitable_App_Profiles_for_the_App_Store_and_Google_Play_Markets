    "As of September 2018, there were approximately 2 million iOS apps available on the App Store, and 2.1 million Android apps on Google Play. Collecting data for over 4 million apps requires a significant amount of time and money, so we'll try to analyze a sample of the data instead. To avoid spending resources on collecting new data ourselves, we should first try to see if we can find any relevant existing data at no cost. Luckily, these are two data sets that seem suitable for our goals:\n",
